    In this project, I will analyze data from COVID-19 cases in the United States with a dataset provided by the CDC 
    from the United States which has records from the beginning of the pandemic in January 2020 until August 2022. 
    I will use data visualization to show how many people are affected by COVID-19, how many people have been 
    hospitalized and where they are located as well how many of those people were admitted to hospitals. 
    This data will also be used to show how many people have died from COVID-19 and which states have the highest 
    number of deaths. 

    This project will provide an overview of the pandemic and patient records, also it will demonstrate graphics made
    using Python libraries, including Pandasql which allows you to query pandas DataFrames using SQL syntax and Plotly 
    for visualizations.

    You can consult the dataset information from the following source and below you can access to the github repository.
